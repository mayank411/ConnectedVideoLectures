<xml><segment><text>The topic for this lecture is introduction to Software Engineering.  Let us first see the outline of this talk. We will begin by looking at the nature of  software projects, why they are challenging, why very often the projects are not successful.  Then we will see how an engineering approach can be helpful to us.  We will particularly look at engineering projects in other domains not necessary only software  engineering and see how we can learn from them.After that we will talk about software  process. We will define typical step in a software process which can be helpful to us  in developing large software systems. We will then define what the characteristics of a  good process are and we will look for such a good process for development. We will examine  waterfall model for software development, we will also look at some of other well known  models and finally we will briefly touch upon project planning. You will see more on this  in another module.</text><question-answer-pair><question>What encourages evolutionary acquisition and Iterative and Incremental Development?</question><answer>Some

Or the software solution could be something for a very single well defined task  such as a pay roll, or it could be an application which covers all functions of a business organization,  that means it could be an enterprise wide software.  You can have software which functions from one location, or it may be a distributed software  solution, software solution which may be designed for batch operation, or it may be a real time,  or it may be meant only to give information to public, or it may be a machine critical.

So developing large and complex software is  challenging because, firstly it is very effort intensive, we have to organize the work very  meticulously, and high cost is involved. So in case the solution is not successful the  entire investment goes waste. It also can take long development time. Then  we have to take into account the changing requirements of the users. And finally there  is a high risk of failure. And this risk may be in terms of variety of aspects. The users  may not accept the solution, it may not meet the performance, or the solution is such that  it is not possible to maintain it up to date.</text><question-answer-pair><question>What was the term ``software'' first used in by John W.

We must realize that developing a software is quite different from developing one time  program which we typically develop as a student or for ourselves, we just develop try it up,  see if we get some useful results and throw it away.We are not talking of software solutions  of this kind. We are talking about software solutions which are of long duration.  They give important service to people or organizations and this is what would be the focus of software  in our course.  When do we call a software solution to be successful? Basically software projects have  not always been very successful. The success rate in fact is much lower compared to the  success rate in other engineering domains.  When do we consider a software application to be successful?  These are the different criteria on which we will say that software developed by somebody  is successful.  Firstly the development should be completed. Now that sounds obvious.Unless the development  is completed the software cannot be used. But this is the reality that very often projects  are abandoned in between and then they are not completed. Now having completed the software  then the other criteria are that the software should be useful.  It should be usable and finally it must be used. This is what it really means is that  users would find attracted to the solution that you have developed, and they would be  keen to use it in their day to day functioning. What all these criteria are implying is that,  besides being useful, the software should be also cost effective and should be maintainable.  The point we are making is that software has a fairly long life and it needs to be maintained.  It should be kept up to date just like we need to maintain other equipment. So only  the software solutions which are usable, cost effective and maintainable would be considered  successful by any user.  What are the reasons for failure? There can be many reasons; the first is the  slippage in the schedule, meaning the software is not ready in time. Or it is becoming too  costly to complete the project and it may be therefore abandoned in between.  It does not solve the user problem, if the software development has been completed but  the users do not find it useful, it is a failure. The software may be of very poor quality.  It may not be maintainable. So these are the different reasons for failure.  What leads to such problems? Primarily the main reason or the important  reason for such problems is the ad hoc approach to software development.  Very often we assume that it is so straight forward you have to just sit across a machine  and talk to the user, quickly understand the requirement and start coding. This is not  the way to develop large software projects. You need to understand that such approaches  are likely to or very likely to lead to failures. So let us see what these reasons are.  Very often there is no planning done for the development work. So when a project is undertaken  we need to define different milestones, how the development would be completed step by  step. Deliverables to the users are not identified.  There is a very poor understanding of user requirements on what exactly does the user  expect from software.  There is no control or review.</text><question-answer-pair><question>What does the development of embedded software such as used for controlling consumer products, require the development process to

progress systematically. Because  we are committing lot of resources, we are committing lot of cost and time. Therefore  it is very important that we control and review the progress continuously.  Of course the reason for failure could also be technical incompetence of the developer.  They need to understand the changes in technologies, the new techniques and tools which are available  for software development. So the developers also need to keep themselves up to date with  the latest trends and technologies. Finally there is another reason that both  the users as well as the developer have a very poor understanding of the cost and effort  involved in large software project. So these different types of reasons basically  which is implying some kind of ad hoc ness in software development. These are the reasons  which are typical for a failure of a software project.  Now we see in day to day life that there are many other successful engineering projects.  These are large projects and they carry out typical functions which are requiring a large  effort in development. So some of the projects which are mentioned here you can see that  they are very common and they are very successfully completed.  For example these projects could be building large bridges, dams, power plants, even aircraft,  missiles. These are big engineering artifacts, these are big engineering projects and they  generally you see that they are successful. So what we would like to see is what is that  these other disciplines have, which we need to learn and also apply for developing software.  Now what is common here is an engineering way of doing things. What does this engineering  way consists of. Basically what it emphasizes is that, we must go through a cycle of defining  what we want to build, what are the functions an artifact should do, how to design it and  then we should develop it. So there is a specified design /develop cycle which goes through the  process and which leads to the development of the solution.  So an engineering approach consists of developing something, which meets the specifications  efficiently, cost effectively and at the same time they ensure quality. It is the responsibility of developers to ensure  that the project would meet the specifications cost effectively and also that we have good  quality build into the solution. So there are some scientific principles in  every engineering domain that we must apply to arrive at a good solution.</text><question-answer-pair><question>Who was used to film a scene in Danny

have a well defined repeatable and predictable  approach. Large projects will benefit by a very systematic approach.It should be repeatable.  So that if we are successful once, then the same approach, the same methodology can also  be used in another approach, in another project and we also will have a very high probability  of a success. So repeatability and predictability are important characteristics of an engineering  approach.  Large projects where we have large number of people, funding involved, need to be managed.And the scale makes a big difference. Compare building of a house, if you are building a  very small house, may be a hut or you are building a 2-storeyed house or a 15-storeyed  apartment building, it is a question of scale.The projects are becoming larger and larger,  and therefore you are committing more resources, more people, more cost. And therefore it becomes  very important that these projects are handled systematically and we do appropriate the management  of the project. So large projects have to have a good systematic  approach, the project itself requires management. Quality is of course important and what does  it relate to. Quality relates to failures obviously. So something that we design must  not fail. It must meet the specifications and it should also have efficiency, good performance,  and usability, besides probably other quality factors. We must note that people are willing  to pay for quality. As we see in daily life that when we go and  buy something, may be you are buying a T.V, you have a sense of quality. You know that  different equipment or different T.V sets have different prices. And you are willing  to pay a higher price, because you feel that the equipment offers a better quality.  Now same thing would happen with the software.</text><question-answer-pair><question>What is ISO 9241 standard ISO 9241?</question><answer>ISO 9241 standard ISO 9241 is a multi-part standard that

quality software,  we can expect users to pay for such high quality software. So quality is important in any engineering  approach.Large engineering projects of course, involve  different types of people and we need to manage the work carried out by these people. For  example, again considering a development of a large building here you will have people  who are architects, civil engineers, electrical engineers, masons, carpenters etcetera will  be involved in the team, which will develop the building. And they will all have specific  qualifications for contributing towards the project.When they carry out this project, they also need to be continuously supervised. Supervision  is an essential aspect of quality assurance and we know that this is done by different  people whose role is to carry out day to day on sight monitoring when buildings are being  constructed. In a large project, there are many deliverables.  Things are not developed over night. So again taking example of a civil engineering project,  you have different deliverables which are produced in a specific order and they are  reviewed and only when they are accepted we go to the further development.  For example the architectural plan is made by an architect. The user may even want to  see a model of the building, you make them structural diagrams, you make foundation diagrams,  and you make electrical cable layouts and so on. So there are many deliverables and  these are reviewed and only when they are approved, we go ahead and carry out the task.  More over to further guarantee that work and its quality, we have some well defined standards.These standards or regulations must be followed in order to get a successful engineering solution.  In every engineering field such standards, or regulations, or conventions are well established  and we must be aware of these.The purpose of the standard is to ensure high quality  and to contribute towards success of a project. So as we carry out a large project, we go  through multiple steps, we achieve different milestones. These milestones, which may be  for example, be development of an architectural plan. These milestones are delivered, reviews  are carried out and when they are accepted, we go further.Because of these well defined  milestones in every other engineering project, the progress is visible.  So this visibility of progress in development is important criteria for an engineering solution.  We need to carry out in order to successfully execute a large project a proper systematic  planning of a project. And also have a continuous management in place, so that we ensure a smooth  progress in the project that we are doing.  Now software, of course is different from other engineering domains. We can list some  of the essential differences; firstly the cost of production in software is concentrated  in development. It is easy to make copies. So once you develop a successful product it  can be installed at many locations. That by itself does not have a cost associated. So  much of the cost is concentrated in the development itself and therefore we need to ensure that  this is a cost effective in its approach.  Maintenance in the case of software consists of making corrections and making enhancements.And progress in development of software is often difficult to measure.  Sometimes we hear that software is eighty percent complete or 90% complete. Actually  it is very difficult to get a sense of what this eighty or ninety percent may mean. This  is a problem typical of software development because it does not have any physical dimension  as you see in the case of a building. So when you see that the building which probably  is a 50-storeyed building has already reached thirty five stories, you get a sense of progress.But this doesn't happen in the case of software. It is very important that the methodology  or the approach we follow is a step by step approach and every step when completed gives  us a signal that we have made some definite progress in the development. So it is very  important that we define these stages very clearly.We need to apply an engineering approach to the software. Because software is different  from other products it is even more important that we take an engineering approach in software  development.  What are the characteristics, what do we need to do in following an engineering approach  for the software? First we should attempt to estimate the cost  and effort involved in a software project. We should plan and schedule the work.  We should involve users in defining requirements, what exactly is expected from the software,  only users can tell us. So we must involve them in the beginning itself to guarantee  that they will accept the solution that we are developing.  Then we should identify the stages in the development.  We should define clear milestones. So that once those milestones are achieved, we know  how far we have come and how much further we have to go. So progress can be seen.  We must schedule reviews and the purpose of scheduling of reviews is both for the quality  and for the control. We should define deliverables.  And any large project requires extensive planning. And in order to control quality and the workability  of the product we should include some steps which will ensure quality.</text><question-answer-pair><question>What was awarded by Rensselaer

plan extensive testing. So that what we develop  and before it gets used is usable. And this can be ensured through extensive and proper  testing.These are the different guidelines for ensuring a successful software project.  Now what do we need to do is, somehow we need to put all this in the form of a proper process.  And use that process as an engineering approach to software development. We need to develop  a methodology which will take into account, these aspects of software and these issues  in development of any project to define some kind of methodology or an approach.  Now job of software developer naturally involves interacting with different people, and that  is what makes it slightly challenging or difficult.  Software developer on one hand has to deal with users. These are the users of the software.  They are having some expectations. They are faced with some problems and they expect the  software to solve those problems. But very often they are not in a position to clearly  define what they expect from the software. So we are dealing with users who have ill  defined requirements in their mind. Their focus is ease of use and response time. They  want software to be very simple to use, it should also be very efficient. So these are  what users expect from software.  On the other hand software developer also needs to deal with technical people and these  are the people who are going to develop the solution. And they do not share the same concerns  as expressed by the users. But their focus is to develop the code for the software, do  the database design etc. That is, they are more technically inclined people. They are  not so much concerned with ease of use or functionality and so on.And finally the developer has to deal with the management, whose concern is the cost  benefit from the project. They consider the project as involving some investment; they  are expecting proper return on this investment. They are concerned about the successful project  and they want to develop the software in limited cost and in limited schedule.  So the job of the software developer is challenging because he has to balance the expectations  of different people who are associated with the project.  So in summary what we have really said is that a large software development is very  challenging activity, in order to ensure its success, it is important to follow an engineering  approach. This engineering approach like other engineering approaches, in other engineering  fields, consists of a well defined process.So process is essential in software development.  So let us talk of what kinds of processes are involved in the development of the large  software. Before that first let us understand the term  process itself.Process consists of different types of activities. It defines a set of steps,  these steps or activities need to be carried out in a particular order. Software process  deals with both the technical and the management issues.It has to develop a solution using  computer technology, it has to deal with management and come up with a cost effective solution.  There are different types of processes involved in a software domain. Firstly there is a process  for software development itself. The purpose of this software is obviously is to develop  software. So software development is a process whose goal is to produce the required software.There may be multiple such processes in an organization. And when you undertake a new  project you may decide to follow an appropriate development process.  The first type of process we have identified here is the process for software development,  using which the actual development happens. Then there is a process for managing the project  itself. Because as we said earlier large numbers of people are involved in the project, many  activities will be carried out, and it is going to be involving some cost.  In order to control all these we need to have efficient management. So you need to define  management process itself, which will consist of defining the plan for the project.  What does the plan consist of? Plan consists of identifying the different activities, when  and how they will be done, who will be responsible for doing them. These are the components of  the software project plan and the plan needs to be defined.  Then we need to also have a process for supervising that plan. That is the control part.</text><question-answer-pair><question>What draws a metaphor between modern software development and the apprenticeship model of medieval Europe?</question><answer>The

estimation, you  need to prepare schedule, you need to provide resources, and you need to continuously take  a feedback from the development process which will help you in controlling the project and  also ensuring the quality. So you need to look constant monitoring.So the second type  of process that we have defined now is the process for managing the software project.  And the next process is process for handling the change and for handling the configuration  of the software that we are developing. What we have to realize is that software development  could be a long activity, may require months to complete.And during this time there could  be some changes in the scope of the software. We need to accept these changes, we need to  resolve them, we need to identify whether we include those changes in the software that  is being developed. And in the process we need to define the configuration of the software  system that we are developing. If necessary we may create different versions  of the software and then release them as and when the changes are implemented.</text><question-answer-pair><question>What does the development of
